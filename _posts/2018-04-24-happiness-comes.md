title: Happiness comes from solving problems
---

We all persue happiness and it does not come easy. We all want to avoid problems at all cost but the reality is problems are inevitable. When we solve one problem, it will create new problems. Problems that we solve, will bring happiness. "Solving is the keyword to happiness" as Mark Manson suggests in his book, The subtle art of not giving a F*ck.

To quote few other lines from his book.

> If you're avoiding your problems or feel like you don't have any problems, then you're going to make yourself miserable. If you feel like you have problems that you can't solve, you will likewise make yourself miserable. The secret sauce is in the solving of the problem, not in not having problems in the first place.

> True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving.

As Mark says avoid these two mental states in order to be truly happy and not only for a short term but in a long term by looking at the underlying problems and solving them one by one.

1. *Denial.* Don't be in denial about the problems exists in first place.
2. *Victim Mentality.* Why me? you should not choose to believe that the only problem is you. Don't potrait yourself as victim in your own eyes by blaming others for your problems, it will only lead to life of anger helplessness, and despair.
